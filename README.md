# Standardized README Template
This is the standardized README for new repositories. 
<br>

When writing your README for your new repository, make sure to answer the following questions: <br>
        1. What does the project do? <br>
	2. Why is the project useful? <br>
	3. How can users get started with the project? <br>
	4. Where can users get help with your project? <br>
	5. Who maintains and contributes to the project? <br>
 
Other things that can be included in a README are: <br>
	- Dependencies (libraries, repositories, programs, etc) <br>
	- Documentation (Useful commands/processes/information) <br>
 	- Roadmap <br>
  	- Instructions to build and run code <br>
   	- Known issues/bugs

# Documentation Standards

## Inline Documentation
When writing code, it is generally good practice to comment on specific blocks of code and their intended function and any errors that need to be addressed.

## Internal Documentation
When creating a project, documenting the intended architecture/design, usage/implementation guidelines, related research, and other documents in the documentation section of repositories is generally good practice as it allows for reusing code and repositories.
